# typeTester
This is a rework of my CS290 (Web Development) final project. The original can be fount [here](https://github.com/amedeekirk/final-project-typetest-sergio-cameron-joseph).

## About
I have revamped this project, originally written in vanilla javascript for the front end and PHP for the server, to utilize Vue.js and Node.js. I developed this project in order to learn the latter mentioned langages

## Running Locally
To run this project locally, you must have Node.js/NPM installed.
To install the dependencies, run 
```
npm install
```
Next, simply run 
```
npm start
``` 
and the project will run on localhost:3000.

## The Future
Coming soon is functionality to the buttons in the navbar. Unfortunately, 'My Account' and 'Leaderboard' have not been developed yet, but are next on my todo list for this project. Please look out for future updates. 

As well, once fully developed, I will find a host for the project. This will prevent those reading this to not have to run the project locally
